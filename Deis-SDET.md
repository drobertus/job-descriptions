# Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET), Deis

## We Are

Our passions revolve around improving how the world builds, tests, delivers,
and operates software. We practice what we preach. We are:

- caring individuals
- open source advocates
- conference presenters and organizers
- new technology and language early adopters
- composable software creators
- seasoned (dev)ops personnel

## We're Known For

- [deis][deis] - the fully open source Heroku-workflow inspired Platform as a
Service for [Docker][docker] containers
- [helm][helm] - the package manager for Kubernetes

## You Might Be

1. A champion of industry best practices such as:

  - continuous integration
  - continuous delivery
  - automated testing
  - 12 factor applications

2. A scrupulous process observer with a desire to remove manual steps from other
engineers' day to day workflow in order to reduce hindrances in achieving
[flow][flow].

3. A product _and_ people centric engineer. You ponder ways to create
a [better user experience][joelux] as well as lower the barrier to entry for
open source contributors who might just take your software to a level never
before imagined.

4. An avid learner. You like keeping abreast on a wide variety of subjects.
Computers are great, but they're only one of your interests.

## What You'll Be Working On

## The Duties

The Deis team loves creating components that the open source community at large
can seamlessly plug into their existing toolsets and workflows. In order to
maintain the user experience people have come to expect with the Deis product
offerings, we need someone to help us further refine our:

### 1. Automated Testing

You'll spend most of your time bolstering our unit, functional, and end to end
test suites. You'd be building service mocks for functional tests and using bare
metal and cloud providers such as [Amazon AWS][aws], [Digital Ocean][do],
[Google Container Engine][gke], and [Microsoft Azure][azure] to verify all
components work in harmony. You'll also be getting cozy with the
[Ginkgo BDD testing Framework][ginkgo] and a few Bash testing frameworks like
[bats][bats] and [roundup][roundup].

### 2. CI/CD Systems

You'll jump across a few CI systems like [Travis CI][travis] and
[Jenkins][jenkins] to ensure that the tests you have curated are providing
valuable feedback to the team on every change to the codebase.

### 3. Product Quality Visibility

You'll help build an information radiator that provides a visual representation
of each component's current status, quality history, and runtime performance.
